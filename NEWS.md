Version 2.2.0  [2024-03-25]
---------------------------

## Features

  - `--page-number` can now take an optional argument `label` that shows the
    PDF's page label instead of the page index.

## Changes

  - Port to PCRE2
  - Change default value of `--include` to `*.[Pp][Dd][Ff]` to allow for
    different case variations of `*.pdf`.
  - Build system: Switch to C++14
  - Build system: Require poppler-cpp >= 0.36.0, to avoid a nasty bug in earlier
    versions that makes pdfgrep produce wrong results. See
    https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91644
  - Manpage: Specify SYNOPSIS more precisely.
  - Ignore extra whitespace at the end of pages as generated by newer poppler.
    This fixes e.g. `--warn-empty` and our testsuite.
